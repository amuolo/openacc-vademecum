# openacc-vademecum

The resources contained in this repo provide a quick reference to the OpenACC API.
I included tutorials, instructions, and reference informations, from beginner to advanced levels taking inspiration from the Informatik course at ETH for which I was TA.
Almost all the resources presume some reasonable familiarity with C++, and an OpenACC-enabled compiler is required.
